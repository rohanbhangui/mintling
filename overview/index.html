					<p>Hi guys, Mint here. So as you know over the past few weeks I have been campaigning hard for a CS:GO event called MintFest. It will feature a 5v5 Tournament, 100-case case opening and numermous giveaways with chances to win some amazing stuff. I wanted to extend a thanks to all those that have donated so far and encourage others to join me during MintFest. At this time I would like to give a short overview over the event to give everyone an idea of what they can expect at MintFest.</p>

					<h3 class="text overview-title">5v5 Tournament + Prize Pools</h3>
					<p>During the course of our event we will be featuring a 5v5 tournament. Here is how it works:</p>
					<ol class="overview-list">
						<li>Players are organized into 3 skill groups: Silver I to Silver V Master (callsign Alpha), Gold Nova I to Master Guardian II (callsign Bravo), Master Guardian Elite to Global Elite (callsign Delta).</li>
						<li>Once divided, players will be grouped together at random (taking into consideration other factors), within their skill groups, to ensure fair match-ups. Match-ups will be made in advance and such information will be directed to each team captain. If you have not selected a team captain, one should be appointed. Communication with your team, such as scheduling, will be done via your team captain.</li>
						<li>Group stage matches, for each skill group, are knock out based on a Best of 1 (BO1) format. They will be held in the weeks leading up to the MintFest weekend. Teams have a choice from the following maps: Dust2, Nuke, Mirage, Inferno or Cache. Unless teams can come to an agreement over the map, team captains will begin to veto off maps they would like to eliminate until a single map is remaining. This remaining map is the map that the two teams will play their BO1 match on.</li>
						<li>The Finals, for each skill group, will be a Best of 3 (BO3) format. Here the maps will be randomly selected. Map choices are the same as in the BO1 format.
						<li>In each skill group, there will be 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> place prize pools. Of the 5 players in each of the prize pools, tickets (awarded through donations) will be pull at random and will determine who will have first pick when picking weapons from the prize pool. More tickets you have more chance you have of picking first in each prize pool. Names will continue to be drawn among the remaining team members for the prize pool and those names will get to pick from the remaining items.</li>
						<li>MVP for each skill group will also be awarded a prize (based on viewer strawpoll)</li>
					</ol>

					<h3 class="text overview-title">100-case Case Opening</h3>
					<ul class="overview-list">
						<li>100 cases will be opened over a 2 day period. Atleast 1 of the weapons acquired from the case opening will be raffled off to both viewers and donators.</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 class="text overview-title">Minty Care Packages + Grand Prize</h3>
					<ul class="overview-list">
						<li>Every few hours a different Minty Care Package will be "dropped", and raffled off to donators only.</li>
						<li>To end off the stream, both donors and viewers will get the opportunity to have a chance at winning a grand prize item. Donors will be permitted to enter both the donor only and general viewer giveaways.</li>
						<li>Note:  A donor can win a maximum of 1 Minty Care Package and 1 grand prize item. Restrictions on other prize winning limits is at the discretion of the stream.</li>
					</ul>
